            <h3>Written by one of the lead composers, ZachDK</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Well, here it is! The OST discussion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Music is one of the most important parts of a Friday Night Funkin' mod. Shocker, I know. But I'm glad to
                say
                that Undertale: Funk-Mode is in good hands.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The team has four lead composers. Me, GontheGhost, Spunky Tunky, and Soba Noodles. We, alongside many of
                the other composers, have been working very hard to contribute to this mod and make it's OST the best it
                can be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm very proud of our work, and we can't wait to get all of this out to you. Undertale: Funk-Mode has
                really
                been a wonderful experience to work on. I've learned and improved with each passing day, working on this
                mod. I hope you guys learn and improve as well, in your own personal projects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's thanks to you all that
                we can even make this mod!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some of the songs we've been given permission to show you.</p>

                <h2>Coding Struggles pt. 1</h2>
                <h3>Written by the Lead Programmer, Glintfish</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Hello, im glintfish, lead programmer for Undertale: Funk Mode!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Damn, this mod has been in the works for an entire year now. Its kinda crazy to think about!
                    Ive been in this community for around 4 years now, and to think about how Funk Mode has been here
                    for a fourth of it is... idk! Weird i guess? But a good kind of weird. Time flies by fast!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I know you didnt come here to read about my life story so ill cut it short and move onto the coding
                    for the mod.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lets not beat around the bush, coding is the main thing keeping this mod from coming out.
                    Who would've guessed that coding is really hard!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Generally the thing thats been the biggest issue is planning ahead.
                    We as the coders wanna make the mod as easy as possible to develop for, so that future updates can
                    come out faster,
                    but that also means a lot of planning, a lot of rewrites and refactors, and a LOT of code...
                    Although, not really.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Im not going to lie, im an optimization nut. I love optimizing and squeezing as much performance as i
                    can out of
                    literally anything, and im especially doing it now because i want EVERYONE to be able to experience
                    Funk Mode without
                    any issues.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As of writing (3. May 2025.), the mod has ~3200 lines of code. compared to Psych 0.7.3's ~31000 or
                    our old engines
                    ~10000, and you can see the difference! I didn't want useless code and random stuff cluttering the
                    codebase,
                    so we ended up switching engines to one I was in the process of working on, which turned out to be a
                    huge success!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Everything is insanely modular, easy to work with and understand, and also DOCUMENTED, unlike
                    literally every
                    other FNF mod / engine out there. I dont wanna sound like im bragging, but im just insanely happy
                    with the
                    way everything was done for this mod.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now back to the actual progress. Again, as of writing, I just finished the mods new overworld
                    implementation, and it
                    works like a charm. Honestly, we don't really have that much stuff left to finish! Unfortunately, I
                    am usually the
                    one pulling most of the weight as our other coders are fairly busy, but I don't mind that- I like
                    working on Funk Mode!</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is what it looked like before I fixed it LMAO</p>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/images/coding-struggles/fuckkkkk.png" alt="fuck" title="fuck.overworld">
                <br>
                <p>I am thinking about open sourcing Funk Mode once it releases, but at the same time, I don't want
                    people blatantly
                    stealing all my hard work, which is what the community usually does. I dunno, we'll see when the
                    time comes!</p>
                <br>
                <p>That's it for now, thanks for reading!</p>
