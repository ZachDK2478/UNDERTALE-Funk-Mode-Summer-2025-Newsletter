        <h1>Welcome to the first Official UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode Newsletter.</h1>

        <h2 style="color: yellow;">Section 1 (written by Gian, the mod director)</h2>

        <h3 style="color: green;">WELCOME TO THE UNDERGROUND!!!</h3>
        <p>Oh man, a newsletter? For an undertale mod? How had i not thought of that before!</p>
        <p>Clearly we aren't copying supreme leader Tobias Fox!!</p>
        <p>In all seriousness, I think using newsletter system is the best way to give people information, news, or
            teasers about the mod.</p>
        <p>Of course, don't expect this to be super constant. It will only be used when we have something to show, or to
            directly give the public news about the mod's development in a much more detailed way than just tweeting
            about it.</p>
        <p>That is, of course, if we don't forget that this little site exists.</p>

        <h3 style="color: green;">What is UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode?</h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZachDK2478/utfm-newsletter-spring2025/refs/heads/main/image/GfriendSigma.png"
            alt="sig_gfriend">
        <p>In simple words, UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode is yet another Undertale inspired FNF mod with the purpose of being as
            faithful as possible to the original material, trying our best to showcase what Undertale's world has to
            offer to Bfriend and his awesome Gfriend.</p>
        <p>The story is going to be the same as the original game, but with a few slight changes to make it feel fresh
            and to adapt it to Bfriend and Gfriend in addition to adding small elements of its own to make the gameplay
            a little more entertaining for the player.</p>
        <p>There really isn't much surprise in this, it's just Undertale but what if ermmmmmm if BF and GF was part of
            that universe and frisk did not exist :shocked:
        <p>We really have a lot of plans and things in mind for this, since in some way we want this to be a "love
            letter" to the Undertale community if you want to see it that way.</p>
        <p>Still, doing this kind of thing is really time consuming so we will all be working hard and doing as best as
            possible!!!!</p>

        <h3 style="color: green;">PROGRESS</h3>
        <p>Surprisingly, this mod has been making some super fast progress. I can really say with confidence that at
            least a big part of the mod (in terms of the songs) are finished. (The assets, charts, etc.)</p>

        <h3 style="color: green;">What about the songs?</h3>
        <img style="width: 480px; height: 272px;"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZachDK2478/utfm-newsletter-spring2025/refs/heads/main/image/teaser-image1.png"
            alt="Teaser Image 1">
        <p>The songs have been one of the quickest things to finish.</p>
        <p>We had some ideas put together from the very beginning, so it was very fun to experiment and do everything.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, all the songs have been finished and charted. Which means they are fully playable!!</p>
        <p>This demo will only contain five songs in the Ruins. The demo will only be in the Ruins.</p>
        <p>Although, in the future we will add more songs for the Ruins eventually.</p>

        <h3 style="color: green;">How will the overworld work?</h3>
        <p>In order to not make the mod last 7 hours unnecessarily, we decided that the best thing for us to do would be
            to put summarized versions of Undertale areas.</p>
        <p>This will make it so that the gameplay isn't stressful or unnecessarily long.</p>
        <p>Even so, the areas will retain their characteristics and important elements.</p>
        <p>We simply do this to make the mod more managable and simple for everyone.</p>
        <p>Also, I'm pretty sure that some people will want to go straight to the songs and not do any overworld stuff.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: green;">How about Pico or some of the other character from the FNF Universe?</h3>
        <p>Pico is officially confirmed for the mod, although he will not appear in this demo. However, we already have
            a good couple of ideas in the works for him, in this case Pico will have songs with the theme of the fangame
            Undertale Yellow since we feel that it is more appropriate for him.</p>
        <p>Regarding other characters from the FNF universe, we still don't have anything for them but we know that
            there are people who want to see Nene and even Senpai even though they are not our priority for now.
        <p>Even so, if we find a couple of ideas and ways to include them that work and make sense for the story, you
            can trust that Pico won't be the only character to be here.</p>

        <h3 style="color: green;">ROBLOX SKINS?!??!!!!???</h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZachDK2478/utfm-newsletter-spring2025/refs/heads/main/image/dance.gif"
            alt="Roblox WAHOOOOO">
        <p>Yep! You read that right, Bfriend, Gfriend, and Pico now have Roblox skins and if for some reason you want to
            be them, you now have the opportunity!</p>

        <h2 style="color: red;">GET THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!!</p>
